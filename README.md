### About ###

[GeoPackage MapCache](http://ngageoint.github.io/geopackage-mapcache-android/) is a [GeoPackage Library](http://ngageoint.github.io/GeoPackage/) app for Android that utilizes and demonstrates the functionality in [GeoPackage Android](https://github.com/ngageoint/geopackage-android) and [GeoPackage Android Map](https://github.com/ngageoint/geopackage-android-map).  The GeoPackage SDKs are Android library implementations of the Open Geospatial Consortium [GeoPackage](http://www.geopackage.org/) [spec](http://www.geopackage.org/spec/). The app and SDK are listed as [OGC GeoPackage Implementations](http://www.geopackage.org/#implementations_nga) by the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency.

The MapCache app provides read and write access to GeoPackage files, including features and tiles. Features are visualized and editable on the map. Tiles are visualized on the map and can be loaded from a tile provider or WMS url.

#### Map Key ####

When building this project locally, a Google API key is required to see map tiles:
 * Maps SDK for Android: [Get API Key](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android-sdk/signup)

On the [Google Cloud Platform Console](https://cloud.google.com/console/google/maps-apis/overview), configure "Maps SDK for Android" credentials (replacing the example fingerprints).

| Package name           | SHA-1 certificate fingerprint                               |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| mil.nga.mapcache       | 12:34:56:78:90:AB:CD:EF:12:34:56:78:90:AB:CD:EF:AA:BB:CC:DD |
| mil.nga.mapcache.test  | 12:34:56:78:90:AB:CD:EF:12:34:56:78:90:AB:CD:EF:AA:BB:CC:DD |

In your `gradle.properties`, add your API Key (replacing the example keys)

```
RELEASE_MAPS_MAPCACHE_API_KEY=AIzaSyBdVl-cTICSwYKrZ95SuvNw7dbMuDt1KG0
DEBUG_MAPS_API_KEY=AIzaSyBdVl-cTICSwYKrZ95SuvNw7dbMuDt1KG0
