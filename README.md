# GeoPackage SDK Sample

GeoPackage SDK Sample is an app for Android that utilizes and demonstrates the functionality in the [GeoPackage SDK](https://git.geointapps.org/geopackage/geopackage-android).  The GeoPackage SDK is an Android library implementation of the Open Geospatial Consortium [GeoPackage](http://www.geopackage.org/) [spec](http://www.geopackage.org/spec/).

The Sample app provides read and write access to GeoPackage files, including features and tiles. Features are visualized and editable on the map. Tiles are visualized on the map and can be loaded from a tile provider or WMS url.

The GeoPackage SDK Sample App was developed at the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) in collaboration with [BIT Systems](https://www.bit-sys.com/index.jsp). The government has "unlimited rights" and is releasing this software to increase the impact of government investments by providing developers with the opportunity to take things in new directions. The software use, modification, and distribution rights are stipulated within the [MIT license](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/).
